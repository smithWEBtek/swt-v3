A: Meet with your end customer to ask these: 
1.  Where does it hurt: what do you wish your software would do that it doesn’t? 
2.  How do you currently do things, and how does your business work?
3.  Describe your data, how do you interact with it?
4.  Walk me through your “Dream Screen” (the app that would make your life easier if it existed)

B: Build prototype web application, with customer guiding through feedback
C: Get prototype into user-testing as soon as viable
D: Once the basic business functionality is there, start dreaming about other data insights to combine.


V1
With a background in professional music and piano technology, I came to web development through constantly tweaking the software systems around my various businesses, especially in contact relationship management, goal planning and web design.

In 1997, I had the vision of scheduling appointments through the Internet and was the first piano technician in the US to integrate online scheduling in 2003, (integrating a SAS solution into my site). I plan to replace it with a custom scheduling system of my own design, via Rails and JavaScript. As a parent of a teenaged son who is Autistic(non-verbal), another goal is to develop applications that visually stimulate his desire to communicate.

I worked for 5 years with Pragmatic Works (well known MS SQL Server leader), first in tech support, then as a Consulting Sales Engineer where I was exposed to the full life cycle of customer business data issues including source systems, data staging, Extract Transform Load, Analysis and Reporting on the Microsoft SQL Server BI stack. In 2016, I decided to pursue 'open-source' web development through the remote-based Full Stack Web Development program at Flatiron School in NYC.  

I plan to integrate customer source business data (of all formats), but with open-source web technologies (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Ajax, React) as the 'presentation front end'. I am particularly interested in combining both the typical day to day business reporting on past day/week/month/year, but also in applying externally sourced data sets (via APIs and web scraping), to produce new business insights with seemingly unrelated data. 

I plan to complete my course work for Flatiron School by summer of 2017, and I am open to work as a full-time developer (W2) position, temp-to-hire (1099) or with short term projects through my own consulting practice.



totally agree but I do think it could be shorter. Consider paring it down to one paragraph -- think of it as your elevator pitch. How can you give someone a concise, cohesive, and engaging overview of your background and invite them to get in touch either to take a look at your work or to invite you to collaborate on something?




V2
A life long learner in professional music and piano technology, I came to web development through constantly tweaking the software systems around my various businesses, especially in contact relationship management, goal planning and 3D design/build projects.

Five years as Consulting Sales Engineer on the Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence stack, schooled me in business logic, data sources, presentation layer and the entire consulting / technical sales cycle. 

In 2015, I began to pursue a technical practice through 'open-source' web development without the constraints of Microsoft or a corporate environment as an expensive middleman. The Full Stack Web Development program at Flatiron School in NYC, enabled me to combine my experience with web technologies to solve business problems through code and the browser.

The focus of 'smithWEBtek' is to provide complete data solutions for individuals, organizations and businesses who need to connect disparate data sources, business logic and multiple views of their data through the browser.

As my great grandfather would have said while looking up from plowing his fields: "....son, a plain website with accurate and refreshable data is far preferable to a fancy site with data you can't use". Likely, he would have then spit out whatever he was chewing on and proceed to spread manure. (very similar to what happends on a well attended Microsoft technical call).


I was actively involved in scoping engagements, matching skillsets, writing legal Statements of Work and strategizing with both the technical and sales sides of the house to keep everybody billable. It was a popular role within the company with the task of telling 30 top-notch consultants to do things they might not want to do and 18 sales reps not to promise things we couldn't deliver.

 revenue-producing actions, 
to find the data those actions require,
putting the data behind those actions in the browser such that the user will produce value with it. 

 that that actually make money, the bones’ data and the unique needs of the user who creates value with that data.






web with business data, so a user can do more of what they want without suffering from technology.


technologies in prototypes to put actionable business data in front of a user so they can produce more of what they want.



 background includes professional music performance, concert piano technical work and working with special needs people in music. My background is creative,  a creative inventor and business owner 





v1 (long version, takes about 50 seconds without much room for pauses)
my background is in music, as a piano technician, 
with a database, website and Online Scheduling 
I enjoy figuring things out

I worked as a Sales Engineer with SQL Server consultant group,
but it was too much sales, not enough coding

decided on open source web development with Flatiron School,
almost done with the program, building Rails apps---and I love it!
I want to find a team that will put me to work


v2 (shortened version, less biographical, more present tense with very brief background)
I’m a Rails developer/web programmer, background in professional music, wrapping up 
my training with Flatiron School,

using Rails and JavaScript.

I really enjoy distilling a business problem down to its data model and making it
come alive and I want to find a team that will put me to work.

o Url of your recorded pitch
Feedback from person 1 (what worked and what could be improved)
  What works: 
   the upbeat tone of your voice. You sound believable and sincere. 
  What could be improved:  maybe a tad more eye contact with the camera,
  less looking away. But I do like the casual, conversational format.
