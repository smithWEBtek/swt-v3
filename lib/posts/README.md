# Triangle

## Objectives

1. Define a custom error and use it.

## Instructions

* Write a `Triangle` class that accepts three arguments on initialization. Each argument is a length of one of the three sides of the triangle. 

* Give your Triangles an instance method, `kind` that returns, as a symbol, its type. The valid types are:

1. `:equilateral`

2. `:isosceles`

3. `:scalene`

* The `kind` method should raise a custom error, `TriangleError` if the triangle is invalid. Check out the hint below to understand what makes a triangle invalid. Write a custom error class, `TriangleError` and inherit it from `StandardError`. This custom error class should be defined in the same file at the `Triangle` class, but *outside of the class definition of `Triangle`. Like this:
  
```ruby
# lib/triangle.rb

class Triangle
  # triangle code
end

class TriangleError < StandardError
 # triangle error code
end
```

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side. This is a principle known as the _triangle inequality_.

Further, each side must be larger than 0.
