#MY TODO LIST for today

1. Talk less, listen more, be more "impressed" than "impressive"
2. Uplift and encourage through words and actions
3. Assume the best of people first, (review 1 and 2)
4. Before responding: Pause, Read, Listen, Love (review 1-3)
5. Taking offense is NEVER productive. 
6. Time, The Universe and Karma will make your case better than you ever could.
