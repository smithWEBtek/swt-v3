Approach to  folders, naming convention, "the Store"

The Redux Store
	- importing actions
	- actionTypes file to ensure accuracy
	- separate service files for each major data group
	- separate reducer files for each major data group
	- index of actions

Redux state vs Local state
	- Database crud
	- Temporary state
		- Modal or backdrop open or closed
		- Toggling local state

Redux state flow
Action --> API --> Database
			 --> Redux Store
