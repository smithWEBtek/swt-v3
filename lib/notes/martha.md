Here is my feedback:
	1. LinkedIn -- Your profile is looking great, down to your profile pic and header pic :) Two things to update: 1) make sure your technical skills are reflected in the skills section, which I think you can also reorder so that the technical skills you want to highlight show up first; 2) add your technical projects and descriptions to the Accomplishments section.


# LinkedIn
[] Technical skills are reflected in the skills section,
[] LinkedIn accomplishments: add your technical projects and descriptions to the Accomplishments section.


	1. Website -- I love what you've done with it! My main recommendation would be to think about what information you want to communicate on the homepage. I love what you've put together for your "About" page, but for me it is a lot of text to see first thing and try to absorb. Maybe you could have your photo with the line "Hi! I'm Brad." and then just the first two lines in a little bit larger font to introduce who you are and what you do and then move the rest to an "About" only page? Just a preliminary suggestion and some food for thought. Happy to bat some things around with you in person tomorrow, too.

# Website
[] New welcome page:  what to communicate ? 
[] Separate about page
[] Add another project
[] Use project taglines; use bullets for technologies
[] Demo Video w/Credentials


	1. Resume -- I have some overarching thoughts I'd like to discuss in person, if that's ok. More about formatting and presentation than about actual text. I will make any text edits in the Word document and share it with you in a Google Doc.
Looking forward to checking in tomorrow!
