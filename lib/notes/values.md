## Make No Little Plans
We aim high. There’s no plan too ambitious. For us, it’s not enough to teach people how to code – we want to change their lives. It’s not enough to bring this transformative experience to a select few – we hope to use our technology to make education accessible to all, regardless of background. We’re building for the whole world.

How? Flatiron creates an education platform that allows people across the globe to learn to code.


## Work Together
Innovation happens at the intersection of technology and creativity. At Flatiron, we study technology and inspire creativity by seeking a diversity of perspective, informed by race, gender, life experience, and passion. We are PhDs and college dropouts; poets and analysts; athletes and activists. And together, we are greater than the sum of our parts.

How? Flatiron School collaborates with the White House and other institutions to find new ways to bring diversity to tech.

## Pursue Mastery
We are all beginners. At Flatiron School, we learn with intent. We find the minimum bar and greatly exceed it. We see errors as opportunities and believe that grit can bring talent to its knees.

How? Flatiron developers, instructors, and students never stop learning and challenge themselves to present at tech conferences around the world.

## Be Scrappy
To match the pace of technology, we move fast. This means embracing change, not running from it, and thriving in ambiguity. We jump across department lines and actively look for problems to solve. Put simply: we get sh*t done.

How? Our employees jump at the chance to grow and reshape their roles – marketers have become developers; developers have become instructors.

## Radiate Positivity
We aim to actively radiate positivity. To improve the world around us in every capacity. To leave every interaction, big or small, better. We find what to love in every pursuit and leverage our passion as a force to motivate others.

How? With passionate instructors and inspiring guest speakers, we make tech a more welcoming space and breed optimism for the future.

## Who is your Technical Coach Lead?
- Enoch
- Nancy
- Jenn
- Dakota

## What resonates with you as you read the Flatiron mission statement and values? *
 We are all beginners and lifelong students. 

## Why is the Technical Coach Team goal important? How does it connect with Flatiron's mission? *
 This role is the personification of the school's mission. Other than study groups and assessments, this role is one of the biggest opportunities for Flatiron to interact "in person" with a student. While a student is a developing coder, they are also "customers" with expectations. Competent help with a human touch can make the difference between their attitude towards finishing the curriculum, paying their bill and ultimately their characterization of the learning experience.

## How can you in your team pursue mastery? *
 For me it will be more review of labs I have not seen for over a year, brushing up on jquery and forming solid habits for researching and delivering study groups. 

## How can you in your team be scrappy? *
 I can work on diagnosing problems faster, "putting the ball back in the student's court" instead of giving answers too soon and learning more about the IDE and it's issues. I can install Virtual Box on my home PC for experimenting with installing Ubuntu and dealing firsthand with student's experience with the IDE.

## How can you work together with your team? *
 I  can get to know everyone better. As I get more comfortable with AAQ, I can be more attentive to quick questions that team members are posting, to try and help them solve an issue. I can watch for more opportunities to contribute insights to the team as a whole through the 'end of shift' form we fill out, by remembering more details of the discoveries I make during a shift.

## How can you radiate positivity in your team and with students? *
 I can edify my team diplomatically when students complain, turning things to a positive note. I can encourage every student I interact with by being friendly and empathizing with their struggle. I can use patience to explain things at the students level, remembering my own learning curve. 

## How can you "make no little plans" to push efficiency and create excellent experience with our students? *
 I  can dive in an tackle hard questions instead of waiting for dispatch to queue them. I can take shifts where people need unexpected time off.  I can get more disciplined about keeping to 20 minute time limit and qbot more help if I can't solve a situation.
