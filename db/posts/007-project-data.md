# Create Your Project Data
This post covers some good habits around preparing a solid dataset for your development project for Sinatra, Rails, React, jQuery, javascript, React, Redux. The idea is to have solid relational data prepared before you begin the thornier parts of client side rendering, and to help you keep your focus during development. 

Columbo (the great TV detective) would often solve a case with many small bits of seemingly unrelated data. When we are in the throes of debugging and trying to make our code work, a great helper can be your seed dataset. You know exactly what the list of 'cats' or 'books' should be and sometimes you don't get 100% clear answers from the developer console or debugger(s).

## CREATE YOUR DATA MODEL

### Why? The better you can shape your tables around actual user needs, the more relevant your applications will be. 
- This is about asking yourself enough questions to determine the shape of your data tables and how they interrelate. - If we are tracking for example, "user votes" on a movie, we have to come up with solid tables and columns to support this business logic. 

- show business question examples
- show database table examples
- ask enough questions to determine 1 to many, 1 to 1, many-to-many

#### takeaways
  #####Nouns and Verbs
  think about Nouns and Verbs as you imagine your data set, 
    often a single (1) Noun takes action (verb) on (many) of another Noun
    who has many of what ?
    what belongs to a single who ?
  #####Join Tables
  where do we need JOIN tables ?
