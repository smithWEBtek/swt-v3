review React, Redux and Javascript all week
 

add spinner for big fetches
reset button: set Students, Teachers and Resources back to active: true
more stuff on the site; add more artifacts 
visually clarify views for Student, Teacher, Lesson and related sub-sections

settle on a pattern for dev and prod 
just change the 5 'service' files to point to local server if you wish
otherwise you can develop local client app, while using Heroku as API

add resources to music-studio app
  -get functional with Cloudinary API
  -get functional with Soundcloud API

blog from this repo
  create workflow using existing placeholders in this app
  create a blogging markdown template, prefilled with styles 
  organize wiki data model
    feed the funnel with topics, sub-topics, ideas that are ripe
    prioritize the funnel, pick one, elaborate its outline and summary
    pick one of those and fill in some detail on first few sub-topics

build out 3-4 varied projects

wiki
  automate bookmarking, storing in wiki, learning, blogging
  1: bookmark 
    chrome bookmarks folder is currently where I capture these
    I export the list every few months, but it should be automated
    it needs to be fed into my wiki machine automatically
    not every bookmark completes the course (bookmark, wiki, hello-world, blog-post, demo-project), but all bookmarks should get to the wiki, with at least:
    Category
    Group
    Topic
    tags

    ( or whatever hierarchy I end up using for wiki )


  2: wiki: 
    categorize and store in this wiki
    use Cloudinary to store related files if needed
    follow wiki structure
    connect it to other wiki categories/groups/topics 
  3: hello world: 
    do the hello world first excersize with this topic
    make it actually work, use it as intended, do an example
    save the example (code, files, ideas, configurations, urls, passwords, API keys, etc.) in a format that will refresh your mind when you find it again in the future

  4: blog post about learning it
  5: go deeper in a project with it
