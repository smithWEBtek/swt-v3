<h3>Why the career change to software development?</h3>
<p>
	The following are some thoughts on why I chose to learn to code. I have a long history of working with my hands doing craft
	work, piano tuning and restoration. Over the last 20 years, I saw customers who were in technology, working from home, living
	in big houses and having the freedom to work creatively while wearing their jeans drinking good coffee. I investigated networking,
	database work, software development and finally settled on web programming as my future.
</p>

<h3>Future security</h3>
<p>
	I'm always thinking of how I can survive and feed my family. It is possible for through coding for a quadriplegic to be able
	to support his family, coding with his mind, and anywhere on the planet. The decline of craft work inspired my desire to
	make a living with my mind instead of my hands
</p>

<h3>Pursuit of perfection</h3>
<p>
	Coding provides infinite possibilities to solve problems. My goal is to connect people and data sets for those who do not
	have access to the rest of the world. My son has severe Autism and is essentially non-verbal. While I would not wish this
	24/7/365 life on anyone, there are some lessons learned and opportunity to someday create software that will take advantage
	of the unique Autistic mind. My son has ingrained patterns that he follows, which are unknown in terms of origin, such as
	placing certain objects in the house, or ensuring that all door locks are vertical at all times, or diligently moving all
	toilet paper rolls to the storage closet (stranding the unaware bathroom visitor!). These hard coded mind paths could be
	interacted with through software, I believe.
</p>

<h3>Instant feedback with web development</h3>
<p>
	I will never tire of the instant gratification of seeing my code work as expected, refreshing the screen seems to produce
	an endorphin blast (a fix that we crave as coders). And, the world at large sees these changes. So you get instant feedback
	and praise for working code.
</p>

<h3>Musical Teaching application</h3>
<p>
	Drawing various technologies into the teacher/student space, future plans include a teaching interface for piano students,
	via web browser. I want to have an iPad or laptop on the student's piano, where we can call up any MP3, YouTube sample,
	music notation software, metronome / drum machine application, recording capability and documenting tools for the lesson.
	Then the student can use all of these tools to keep practicing, refer back to our lesson video, play along with the original
	artist of a piece, compose their own songs, and submit finished lessons via the web portal.
</p>

<h3>Power of analytic information on any endeavor</h3>
<p>
	The ability to leverage data is a never ending opportunity. Web programming makes it possible to gather new input, leverage
	existing data and evolve the kinds of problems we can solve in a any endeavor. The Internet of Things -- IoT, will affect
	us even more in the coming years. There is no end to what can be accomplished by capturing data from our physical world,
	to analyze and enhance life.
</p>

<h3>The myth of specialized knowledge</h3>
<p>
	I believe that specialized knowledge and the paradigm of "the expert" is evolving and disrupting our notion of life learning,
	craft and "resting on one's laurels". The skill to learn and absorb is eclipsing the ability to store specialized knowledge
	for career profit. This is a double-edged sword, where it benefits all to have a more level playing field, but hurts those
	who are pre-wired to gather some knowledge, hoard it and profit from a scarcity mentality. For example, I learned plumbing
	online to the point that I was able to completely replace my home's plumbing. Same with other building trades. The effect
	of YouTube on so many crafts is still unfolding. However, the need for mentoring is greater than ever. I see vast amounts
	of information but need guidance on where to begin, and how to get back on the horse after falling off. So while knowledge
	is becoming more and more "open source", the need for experienced mentors is increasing.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
	Web programming has a huge potential to feed my creative mind, provide for my family and provide a flexible career indefinitely,
	assuming that you are willing to learn on a regular basis.
