<h2>Diet-Tracker</h2>
<p>is a basic CMS (Content Management System) for Users to track their meals and log their experiences while following a particular
	Diet.
</p>

<p>This Rails application was developed as part of the Learn.co Full Stack Web Development course If you are not familiar with
	[Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/), please check it out!</p>

<h3>Major components: Foods, Meals, Groups, Diets and Users.</h3>

<h4>Food</h4>
<p>Food belongs to a specific Group (Dairy, Vegetables, Fruits, etc.). Food has a default calories value of 1 upon creation,
	but can be set to User*s choice.</p>

<p>User can create a new Food and suggest Group, but Admin controls editing of Foods/Groups.</p>

<p>Food *cals* (calories) are tracked by User-meal, and by Group, so we have stats on how many calories the Vegans are eating,
	how many meals, and average calories per meal. </p>

<p>Same goes for Users, we track food calories, number of meals and avg cals per meal.</p>

<h3>Group</h3>

<p>Groups (food groups) are mostly categorical in this version.</p>

<p>Future versions could build views and stats on Groups, comparing outcomes with User eating habits.</p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

</p>Diets are tracked similar to Food calories, and a User can view</p>
<p>Diet Stats showing the stats for their diet aggregating all users on that Diet.</p>

<p>The Diet Stats can show how your (Diet) group*s stats can suffer if you fall off the wagon and eat 7 cheeseburgers while
	on the Vegetarian diet, for example.</p>

<p>Only Admins can create new Diets.</p>

<h3>Meal</h3>

<p>The heart of the app, is the new Meal(s) form, where a User can input 3 meals for a day (breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner).
	Each meal is a separate new instance of the Meal class, and requires a Date, Food and Qty, note/memo is optional, all are
	captured using the custom attributes method *meals_attributes=* in the User model.</p>

<p>Food can be selected (for each meal) via collection_select (dropdown) menu, or the user can enter a new Food for that meal.</p>

<p>If a new Food, the entry is compared with the Database, to find_or_create it, so there are not multiple matching foods.</p>

<p>Qty (quantity) is a number, that multiples whatever the calorie (cals) amount is in the particular Food chosen. This product
	is added up with other users on your same diet.</p>

<h3>User (standard)</h3>

<h4>Registration</h4>

<p>User can register via signup form, or use Omni-auth via Facebook.</p>

<p>Users can be either Standard or Admin (role), default is *standard*.</p>

<p>Only an Admin can access the form to edit a User*s *role*, and make them an Admin.</p>

<h4>User functions</h4>

<p>View</p>

<p>User can see all Foods, Groups, Diets and Diet Stats, but they can*t edit them.</p>

<p>(User can create new Foods via Meals nested form.)</p>

<p>Diet: Each User is on a single Diet at a time.</p>

<p>User can change Diet and is prompted to choose a Diet, if they didn*t choose during registration.</p>

<p>User can view DietStats, showing progress of all users on same Diet.
</p>

<p>Meals: See Meal above</p>

<p>Logs</p>
<ul>
	<li>User can create Log(s) with a date and a note, as much as they want.
	</li>
	<li>Log is nested under User, so only User and Admin can view a User*s logs.
	</li>
	<li>Logs cannot be created for future date, must be today or earlier.</li>
</ul>

<h4>User Data</h4>

<p>User can download their information from the User Account page, in csv format.</p>

<h3>Example of User Account page:</h3>
<p>(Fred logs his struggle with cheeseburgers and cake)</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>User (admin) Admin has all functions of a standard user, in addition to Admin functions. Admin has full CRUD permissions
	for Foods, Groups, Diets and Users Admin logs in and has a pink *admin navigation bar* for their functions </p>

</p>

<h3>Fun stuff</h3>

</p>Celebrity Random Quotes on the home page Home page shows random quote generator User can generate 5 new random quotes with
Celebrity, Verb, Adjective, Food, Diet and Phrase. These are generated using User can use a form to create new Verbs, Adjectives,
Foods, existing Diet and new Phrase. New data is then incorporated into random quote generation. </p>

<p>User can download the current list of random quotes, via CSV download link. method that builds random quotes in quote.rb:

	<h3>Seeds.rb</h3>


	Throughout this project I made heavy use of a seeds file, to populate and re-populate my database with meaningful data. rails
	db:drop rails db:migrate rails db:seed Editing this file and catching errors as I constantly changed my data model, helped
	me understand the application I was building from another perspective. It functioned as a good test of my application, to
	see if I had broken things to where the data model might not consume the data properly. Each model in the database has:
	DATA hash method to build the data using the attributes (columns) in the data file Having a familiar data set helps with
	troubleshooting forms, views and envisioning the user experience interacting with the application. DATA hash for adding
	user and method for making the users from the DATA_users hash:

	<script src=" https://gist.github.com/smithWEBtek/506d596277e4f5c5ec1cb40826946253.js"></script> The seeds file then calls a *master* method (main) that simply calls all the methods (one for each model), and data is
	loaded in the DB. *master method* that includes the *make_users* method.

	<h4>Lesson learned about the seeds.rb file: If a model requires an ID from another model, you have to make sure that the foreign
		key model is loaded first in order (top to bottom). We can*t make the Users until we have Diets, so that the User can have
		a diet_id. We can*t make Foods unless we*ve got Groups created first, because a Food requires a group_id or it won*t validate.
	</h4>

	<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>

	<p>Use the Ruby on Rails framework.</p>

	<p>Your models must include a has_many, a belongs_to, and a has_many</p>
	:through relationship. User has_many :meals, has_many :foods, through: :meals User has_many :logs

	<p>Model acting as a join table for the has_many through.</p>
	<p>Meal model, joins User and Food</p>

	<p>The join model must also store an additional user submittable attribute (not just timestamps or auto-created fields) describing
		the relationship.
	</p>
	<p>Meal form includes Food, either from existing, or User-submitted, without creating duplicates.</p>

	<p>Models should include reasonable validations for the simple</p>
	attributes.</p>
<p>All models have at least 1 validation, some have multiple</p>
<p>All new / edit forms for models have error handling in the forms.</p>
<p>Exception: the new Meal form because it uses nested attributes, can only respond with *Meals is invalid* because the errors
	do not flow up to User in this case. </p>
<p>But, I do have flash message that shows on the form, if Meal is invalid. </p>
<p>There are gems that I could pursue to make this work, but I chose to leave this working as is.</p>
<p>Every other form in the app, lights up with big red errors if data is invalid.</p>

<p>Include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope methods. I have included 10, one for each Diet group of users. Each scoped
	group is an alias of the Diet name, *Vegans* *Carnivores* *Vampires*, etc. These scoped groups are then used to calculate
	DietStats. The methods for this are all in the application_controller.</p>

<p>Include a nested form that writes to an associated model through a custom attribute writer. Meals/new form accepts 3 meals,
	using existing Foods or User-submitted foods, processed by a *meals_attributes=* method in User model.</p>

<p>This (custom attribute writer ) method cannot be provided via the accepts_nested_attributes_for macro because the custom
	writer has to *find_or_create* with User submitted info.</p>

<p>Application must provide a standard user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and passwords. Devise is used in
	this application for User sign_up, sign_in and sign_out.
</p>

<p>Authentication system allow 3rd party login. Facebook, twitter, foursquare, github, etc... OmniAuth is used for authentication
	via Facebook.</p>

<p>Nested resource with the appropriate RESTful URLs. Additionally, your nested resource must provide a form that relates to
	the parent resource. Logs is nested under User Log new form, allows User to capture thoughts and experiences of dieting.
</p>

<p>Forms should correctly display validation errors. Your fields should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class and error
	messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view. Every other form in the app, lights up with
	big red errors if data is invalid. Exception: see new Meal form above</p>

<p>Application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app. Logic present in your controllers should be
	encapsulated as methods in your models. Your views should use helper methods and partials to be as logic-less as possible.
	Follow patterns in the Rails Style Guide and the Ruby Style Guide.</p>

<p>All models use partials for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>new / edit form</li>
	<li>model show view</li>
	<li>model index view</li>
	<li>Naming convention:</li>/ul>

	<li>_form is used for new/edit</li>
	<li>_model is used for show</li>
	<li>_models is used for index</li>

	<li>Partials do not contain html formatting except for the use of tables to display data</li>

	<li>Views do not call Models</li>
	<li>Controllers are DRY according to my current level of understanding and time constraints.</li>



	<h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
	<ul>

		<li>Take the time to write pseudo code, elaborate on visions before proto-typing.
		</li>

		<li>Don*t get sucked into User Interface fun stuff at the expense of core functionality and progress.</li>

		<li>Think out loud through the process of an error. Something expects something and isn*t getting it, for example. Get childlike
			simple about the error message and you*ll likely discover that *something wants something but isn*t getting it*.</li>

		<li>Think in sprints, don*t just code like a squirrel here and there. Decide what you're going to build today, write out some
			directions to yourself and follow them.</li>
	</ul>
