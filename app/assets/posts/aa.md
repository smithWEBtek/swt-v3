wiki
  automate bookmarking, storing in wiki, learning, blogging
  1: bookmark 
    chrome bookmarks folder is currently where I capture these
    I export the list every few months, but it should be automated
    it needs to be fed into my wiki machine automatically
    not every bookmark completes the course (bookmark, wiki, hello-world, blog-post, demo-project), but all bookmarks should get to the wiki, with at least:
    Category
    Group
    Topic
    tags

    ( or whatever hierarchy I end up using for wiki )


  2: wiki: 
    categorize and store in this wiki
    use Cloudinary to store related files if needed
    follow wiki structure
    connect it to other wiki categories/groups/topics 
  3: hello world: 
    do the hello world first excersize with this topic
    make it actually work, use it as intended, do an example
    save the example (code, files, ideas, configurations, urls, passwords, API keys, etc.) in a format that will refresh your mind when you find it again in the future

  4: blog post about learning it
  5: go deeper in a project with it
