    <p>As a professional musician and piano technician, I came to web development through tweaking software in my business (website, contact management, goal planning, music notation and 3D design-build). 

    <p>Five years as a Consulting Sales Engineer (Microsoft SQL Server business intelligence) gave me experience in the diagnosing, scoping, selling and delivery of consulting services for business data, logic and the presentation layer.</p>

    <p>After training on Full Stack Web Development with Flatiron School, I started a web development practice, combining business chops with web technologies to solve problems. </p>
    <strong>The Goal: Functional sites with data you can actually use.</strong>
